# Face_Recognition_Attendance
This project is based on taking attendance of candidates using Facial Recognition.
In this project we can add multiple faces of candidates and get stored it in database.
The records of particular candidate is live updated on database provided by google i.e, Fire-base
This project is very efficient and easy to use for the organisations and colleges for marking attendance of their employees or students.
No human intervention is needed once the application gets started.
